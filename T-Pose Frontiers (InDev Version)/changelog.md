-Sonic, Super Sonic, Amy, Knuckles, Tails, Sage, Big, the Koco, and the Titans are affected.

-Fixed many softlocks galore! Even including one to where Sonic couldn't even fish.

-(Beta Fix)Fixed a bug to where using Sonic's Grand Slam would cause him to get stuck in place eternally.

-(Beta Patch Fix) Restored Sonic's stomp animation due to a bug where using the Stomp Attack (unlocked from the skill tree) would cause Sonic to freeze midair and the surrounding area would go extremely slowly.
