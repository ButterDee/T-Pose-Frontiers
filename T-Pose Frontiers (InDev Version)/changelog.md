## T-Pose Frontiers Beta
-Still in beta, needs more characters to be ruined >:)

-Sonic, Amy, Big, Sage, and the Koco are currently affected by the mod.

-Fixed a bug to where using Sonic's Grand Slam would cause him to get stuck in place eternally.

-(Beta Patch Fix) Restored Sonic's stomp animation due to a bug where using the Stomp Attack (unlocked from the skill tree) would cause Sonic to freeze midair and the surrounding area would go extremely slowly.
